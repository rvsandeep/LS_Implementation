LS_Implementation
=================
Implemting the unix ls command, in view of learning Code Organization.

This Repo is a Java Code for Reimplementing the unix Ls command for learning.
Version 1: provides few options like "-a","-S","-R","-A","-t".

Version 2: added options like "-u","-F","U" and also
learnt how to write JUnit Test Cases and made a test class which uses a folder "expected outputs".

Test Class are not implemented in further versions since they are just reorganzing the code .

Version 3: Reoganized version 2 for better readability.

Version 4: Reorganizing version 3, Removing RecursiveLs.java and implementing the function operateRecursively
in the  BasedOnAttributes.java file.


The test Cases in the repo will not work in computers other then mine since it depends on the files in the directory
and their creation time, size and other such attributes.


OutCome:
Learned the need to organize Code as and when it is written, rather then seperately reorganizing it.
